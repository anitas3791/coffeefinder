# coffeefinder
Uses foursquare API's to find the best coffee spots near you on a map!

I did this project to try out Retrofit, Picasso and do location stuff in Android, as I hadn't done that before.
Also wanted to check out what the Foursquare API's have to offer!

The bulk of the code is in app/src/main/java/com/example/asingh19/coffeefinder folder. Info about the API I used: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/search. 

The app opens up in a map with pins put over coffee shops near you. When you click on a pin, it shows more details in a little info window above the pin. When you click on the info window, it takes you to another screen (VenueActivity) that has more information about the coffee shop like total checkins, ratings, etc.

If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me at anitas3791@gmail.com.
