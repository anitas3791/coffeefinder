# coffeefinder
Uses foursquare API's to find the best coffee spots near you!

I did this project to try out Retrofit, Picasso and do location stuff in Android, as I hadn't done that before.
Also wanted to check out what the Foursquare API's have to offer!

The app opens up in a map with pins put over coffee shops. When you click on it, it shows more details in a little info window above the pin.
When you click on the info window, it takes you to another screen (VenueDetail) that has more information about the coffee shop like total checkins, ratings, etc.

The bulk of the code is in CoffeeFinder/app/src/main/java/com/example/asingh19/coffeefinder (yikes sorry about it being buried!)
